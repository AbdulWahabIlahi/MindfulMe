## 📌 Problem Statement

**Problem Statement 1 – Weave AI magic with Groq**

---

## 🎯 Objective

MindfulMe addresses mental health challenges by providing users with an AI-powered companion to track moods, journal thoughts, and engage in supportive conversations. It serves individuals seeking to understand their emotional patterns and improve mental well-being through regular reflection.

The application leverages Groq's powerful LLMs to analyze user-generated content (text, audio, images) and provide personalized insights, fostering self-awareness and emotional intelligence in a private, judgment-free space.

## 🧠 Team & Approach

### Team Name:  
`Bug Hunters`

### Team Members:  
- Abdul Wahab Ilahi
- Tasmiya Ilahi (Leader)

### Our Approach:  
We chose this problem because mental health support remains largely inaccessible to many, and AI offers a unique opportunity to provide personalized emotional support at scale. Our application aims to bridge this gap by creating a digital wellness companion that understands users' emotional patterns.

Key challenges we addressed include:
- Integrating Groq's LLMs for natural, supportive conversation
- Creating a mood tracking system that visualizes emotional patterns over time
- Developing multi-modal input methods (text, voice, image, audio) for journaling
- Ensuring private and secure handling of sensitive mental health data
- Designing an interface that feels warm and welcoming rather than clinical

During development, we pivoted from a purely chat-based interface to a more comprehensive journal and dashboard approach when we realized users needed to visualize their progress over time to see meaningful patterns.
